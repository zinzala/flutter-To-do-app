# ✅ Todo App (Flutter & RESTful API)
This project was my hands-on exploration of RESTful API integration in Flutter. Using an online API service ([swagger](https://api.nstack.in/swagger)),  This project focuses on smooth UI rendering, optimized data fetching, and error handling, ensuring a great user experience. However, since the API does not persist data, every time the internet is reconnected, the app starts fresh.

<br></br>
## Features
✅ CRUD Operations – Uses GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to manage tasks <br>
✅ Optimized UI Rendering – Prevents unnecessary rebuilds using MediaQuery.sizeOf()<br>
✅ Async Data Handling – Implements FutureBuilder for fetching and displaying todos<br>
✅ Error Prevention – Handles RenderFlex issues caused by keyboard insets using ViewInsets<br>
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Clean, simple, and easy to use

## Technologies Used
 - Flutter (UI Framework)
 - Dart (Programming Language)
 - RESTful API ([swagger](https://api.nstack.in/swagger))
